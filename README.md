## Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces

It has been suggested that the RKHS framework might offer a unified way to describe and understand several types of surrogate modelling techniques. Discuss ......

## Polynomial Approximation based on point evaluations

... also known as stochastic collocation (although that term is often used to mean interpolation exclusively). There are a wide range of polynomial-based approximation techniques that are constructed from point evaluations (computer model runs at particular choices of the input parameters), including interpolation, regression and non-intrusive forms of polynomial chaos approximation based on quadrature.

## Polynomial Approximation not based on point evaluations

Stochastic Galerkin approximation is perhaps an outlier in polynomial approximation, in that it does not use point evaluations. It imposes a Galerkin condition, and in some sense is 'structure preserving'. Also known as intrusive polynomial chaos (if the polynomials chosen for the parameteric/random part are orthogonal).
