## Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces

It has been suggested that the RKHS framework might offer a unified way to describe and understand several types of surrogate modelling techniques. Discuss ......

## Polynomial Approximation based on point evaluations

... also known as stochastic collocation (although that term is sometimes used to mean interpolation exclusively). There are a wide range of polynomial-based approximation techniques that use point evaluations (computer model runs at appropriately chosen inputs).

### Interpolation

### Polynomial Approximation + Regression

### Non-intrusive Polynomial Chaos

## Polynomial Approximation not based on point evaluations

An outlier in polynomial approximation?  Also known as non-intrusive polynomial chaos (if the polynomials chosen for the parameteric/random part are orthogonal)
### Stochastic Galerkin Approximation
